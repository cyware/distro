# Accept connections to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and redirect it to the
# corresponding local port. This technique uses IPtables' NAT capabilities,
# as outlined in https://techanarchy.net/2013/10/inetsim-and-ip-addresses.
# This is convenient for intercepting and redirecting traffic in the
# malware analysis lab when malicious software attempts to connect
# to hard-coded or dynamically-generated IP addresses.
