"OPTIONS\n" +
"       A summary of options is included below.\n" +
"\n" +
"       --help, -h\n" +
"        Show this summary of options.\n" +
"\n" +
"       <input PDF files | - | PROMPT>\n" +
"        A list of the input PDF files. If you plan to combine these PDFs\n" +
"        (without using handles) then list files in the order you want\n" +
"        them combined.  Use - to pass a single PDF into pdftk via stdin.\n" +
"        Input files can be associated with handles, where a handle is\n" +
"        one or more upper-case letters:\n" +
"\n" +
"        <input PDF handle>=<input PDF filename>\n" +
"\n" +
"        Handles are often omitted.  They are useful when specifying PDF\n" +
"        passwords or page ranges, later.\n" +
"\n" +
"        For example: A=input1.pdf QT=input2.pdf M=input3.pdf\n" +
"\n" +
"       [input_pw <input PDF owner passwords | PROMPT>]\n" +
"        Input PDF owner passwords, if necessary, are associated with\n" +
"        files by using their handles:\n" +
"\n" +
"        <input PDF handle>=<input PDF file owner password>\n" +
"\n" +
"        If handles are not given, then passwords are associated with\n" +
"        input files by order.\n" +
"\n" +
"        Most pdftk features require that encrypted input PDF are accom-\n" +
"        panied by the ~owner~ password. If the input PDF has no owner\n" +
"        password, then the user password must be given, instead.  If the\n" +
"        input PDF has no passwords, then no password should be given.\n" +
"\n" +
"        When running in do_ask mode, pdftk will prompt you for a pass-\n" +
"        word if the supplied password is incorrect or none was given.\n" +
"\n" +
"       [<operation> <operation arguments>]\n" +
"        Available operations are: cat, shuffle, burst, rotate, gener-\n" +
"        ate_fdf, fill_form, background, multibackground, stamp, multi-\n" +
"        stamp, dump_data, dump_data_utf8, dump_data_fields,\n" +
"        dump_data_fields_utf8, dump_data_annots, update_info,\n" +
"        update_info_utf8, attach_files, unpack_files. Some operations\n" +
"        takes additional arguments, described below.\n" +
"\n" +
"        If this optional argument is omitted, then pdftk runs in 'fil-\n" +
"        ter' mode.  Filter mode takes only one PDF input and creates a\n" +
"        new PDF after applying all of the output options, like encryp-\n" +
"        tion and compression.\n" +
"\n" +
"    cat [<page ranges>]\n" +
"     Assembles (catenates) pages from input PDFs to create a new\n" +
"     PDF. Use cat to merge PDF pages or to split PDF pages from\n" +
"     documents. You can also use it to rotate PDF pages. Page\n" +
"     order in the new PDF is specified by the order of the given\n" +
"     page ranges. Page ranges are described like this:\n" +
"\n" +
"     <input PDF handle>[<begin page number>[-<end page num-\n" +
"     ber>[<qualifier>]]][<page rotation>]\n" +
"\n" +
"     Where the handle identifies one of the input PDF files, and\n" +
"     the beginning and ending page numbers are one-based refer-\n" +
"     ences to pages in the PDF file.  The qualifier can be even or\n" +
"     odd, and the page rotation can be north, south, east, west,\n" +
"     left, right, or down.\n" +
"\n" +
"     If a PDF handle is given but no pages are specified, then the\n" +
"     entire PDF is used. If no pages are specified for any of the\n" +
"     input PDFs, then the input PDFs' bookmarks are also merged\n" +
"     and included in the output.\n" +
"\n" +
"     If the handle is omitted from the page range, then the pages\n" +
"     are taken from the first input PDF.\n" +
"\n" +
"     The even qualifier causes pdftk to use only the even-numbered\n" +
"     PDF pages, so 1-6even yields pages 2, 4 and 6 in that order.\n" +
"     6-1even yields pages 6, 4 and 2 in that order.\n" +
"\n" +
"     The odd qualifier works similarly to the even.\n" +
"\n" +
"     The page rotation setting can cause pdftk to rotate pages and\n" +
"     documents.  Each option sets the page rotation as follows (in\n" +
"     degrees): north: 0, east: 90, south: 180, west: 270, left:\n" +
"     -90, right: +90, down: +180. left, right, and down make rela-\n" +
"     tive adjustments to a page's rotation.\n" +
"\n" +
"     If no arguments are passed to cat, then pdftk combines all\n" +
"     input PDFs in the order they were given to create the output.\n" +
"\n" +
"     NOTES:\n" +
"     * <end page number> may be less than <begin page number>.\n" +
"     * The keyword end may be used to reference the final page of\n" +
"     a document instead of a page number.\n" +
"     * Reference a single page by omitting the ending page number.\n" +
"     * The handle may be used alone to represent the entire PDF\n" +
"     document, e.g., B1-end is the same as B.\n" +
"     * You can reference page numbers in reverse order by prefix-\n" +
"     ing them with the letter r. For example, page r1 is the last\n" +
"     page of the document, r2 is the next-to-last page of the doc-\n" +
"     ument, and rend is the first page of the document. You can\n" +
"     use this prefix in ranges, too, for example r3-r1 is the last\n" +
"     three pages of a PDF.\n" +
"\n" +
"     Page Range Examples without Handles:\n" +
"     1-endeast - rotate entire document 90 degrees\n" +
"     5 11 20 - take single pages from input PDF\n" +
"     5-25oddwest - take odd pages in range, rotate 90 degrees\n" +
"     6-1 - reverse pages in range from input PDF\n" +
"\n" +
"     Page Range Examples Using Handles:\n" +
"     Say A=in1.pdf B=in2.pdf, then:\n" +
"     A1-21 - take range from in1.pdf\n" +
"     Bend-1odd - take all odd pages from in2.pdf in reverse order\n" +
"     A72 - take a single page from in1.pdf\n" +
"     A1-21 Beven A72 - assemble pages from both in1.pdf and\n" +
"     in2.pdf\n" +
"     Awest - rotate entire in1.pdf document 90 degrees\n" +
"     B - use all of in2.pdf\n" +
"     A2-30evenleft - take the even pages from the range, remove 90\n" +
"     degrees from each page's rotation\n" +
"     A A - catenate in1.pdf with in1.pdf\n" +
"     Aevenwest Aoddeast - apply rotations to even pages, odd pages\n" +
"     from in1.pdf\n" +
"     Awest Bwest Bdown - catenate rotated documents\n" +
"\n" +
"    shuffle [<page ranges>]\n" +
"     Collates pages from input PDFs to create a new PDF.  Works\n" +
"     like the cat operation except that it takes one page at a\n" +
"     time from each page range to assemble the output PDF.  If one\n" +
"     range runs out of pages, it continues with the remaining\n" +
"     ranges.  Ranges can use all of the features described above\n" +
"     for cat, like reverse page ranges, multiple ranges from a\n" +
"     single PDF, and page rotation.  This feature was designed to\n" +
"     help collate PDF pages after scanning paper documents.\n" +
"\n" +
"    burst  Splits a single input PDF document into individual pages.\n" +
"     Also creates a report named doc_data.txt which is the same as\n" +
"     the output from dump_data.  If the output section is omitted,\n" +
"     then PDF pages are named: pg_%04d.pdf, e.g.: pg_0001.pdf,\n" +
"     pg_0002.pdf, etc.  To name these pages yourself, supply a\n" +
"     printf-styled format string via the output section.  For\n" +
"     example, if you want pages named: page_01.pdf, page_02.pdf,\n" +
"     etc., pass output page_%02d.pdf to pdftk.  Encryption can be\n" +
"     applied to the output by appending output options such as\n" +
"     owner_pw, e.g.:\n" +
"\n" +
"     pdftk in.pdf burst owner_pw foopass\n" +
"\n" +
"    rotate [<page ranges>]\n" +
"     Takes a single input PDF and rotates just the specified\n" +
"     pages.  All other pages remain unchanged.  The page order\n" +
"     remains unchaged.  Specify the pages to rotate using the same\n" +
"     notation as you would with cat, except you omit the pages\n" +
"     that you aren't rotating:\n" +
"\n" +
"     [<begin page number>[-<end page number>[<qualifier>]]][<page\n" +
"     rotation>]\n" +
"\n" +
"     The qualifier can be even or odd, and the page rotation can\n" +
"     be north, south, east, west, left, right, or down.\n" +
"\n" +
"     Each option sets the page rotation as follows (in degrees):\n" +
"     north: 0, east: 90, south: 180, west: 270, left: -90, right:\n" +
"     +90, down: +180. left, right, and down make relative adjust-\n" +
"     ments to a page's rotation.\n" +
"\n" +
"     The given order of the pages doesn't change the page order in\n" +
"     the output.\n" +
"\n" +
"    generate_fdf\n" +
"     Reads a single input PDF file and generates an FDF file suit-\n" +
"     able for fill_form out of it to the given output filename or\n" +
"     (if no output is given) to stdout.  Does not create a new\n" +
"     PDF.\n" +
"\n" +
"    fill_form <FDF data filename | XFDF data filename | - | PROMPT>\n" +
"     Fills the single input PDF's form fields with the data from\n" +
"     an FDF file, XFDF file or stdin. Enter the data filename\n" +
"     after fill_form, or use - to pass the data via stdin, like\n" +
"     so:\n" +
"\n" +
"     pdftk form.pdf fill_form data.fdf output form.filled.pdf\n" +
"\n" +
"     If the input FDF file includes Rich Text formatted data in\n" +
"     addition to plain text, then the Rich Text data is packed\n" +
"     into the form fields as well as the plain text.  Pdftk also\n" +
"     sets a flag that cues Reader/Acrobat to generate new field\n" +
"     appearances based on the Rich Text data.  So when the user\n" +
"     opens the PDF, the viewer will create the Rich Text appear-\n" +
"     ance on the spot.  If the user's PDF viewer does not support\n" +
"     Rich Text, then the user will see the plain text data\n" +
"     instead.  If you flatten this form before Acrobat has a\n" +
"     chance to create (and save) new field appearances, then the\n" +
"     plain text field data is what you'll see.\n" +
"\n" +
"     Also see the flatten and need_appearances options.\n" +
"\n" +
"    background <background PDF filename | - | PROMPT>\n" +
"     Applies a PDF watermark to the background of a single input\n" +
"     PDF.  Pass the background PDF's filename after background\n" +
"     like so:\n" +
"\n" +
"     pdftk in.pdf background back.pdf output out.pdf\n" +

"     use - to pass a background PDF into pdftk via stdin.\n" +
"\n" +
"     If the input PDF does not have a transparent background (such\n" +

"       [owner_pw <owner password | PROMPT>]\n" +
"\n" +
"       [user_pw <user password | PROMPT>]\n" +
"        If an encryption strength is given but no passwords are sup-\n" +
"        plied, then the owner and user passwords remain empty, which\n" +
"        means that the resulting PDF may be opened and its security\n" +
"        parameters altered by anybody.\n" +
"\n" +
"       [compress | uncompress]\n" +
"        These are only useful when you want to edit PDF code in a text\n" +
"        editor like vim or emacs.  Remove PDF page stream compression by\n" +
"        applying the uncompress filter. Use the compress filter to\n" +
"        restore compression.\n" +
"\n" +
"       [flatten]\n" +
"        Use this option to merge an input PDF's interactive form fields\n" +
"        (and their data) with the PDF's pages. Only one input PDF may be\n" +
"        given. Sometimes used with the fill_form operation.\n" +
"\n" +
"       [need_appearances]\n" +
"        Sets a flag that cues Reader/Acrobat to generate new field\n" +
"        appearances based on the form field values.  Use this when fill-\n" +
"        ing a form with non-ASCII text to ensure the best presentation\n" +
"        in Adobe Reader or Acrobat.  It won't work when combined with\n" +
"        the flatten option.\n" +
"\n" +
"       [keep_first_id | keep_final_id]\n" +
"        When combining pages from multiple PDFs, use one of these\n" +
"        options to copy the document ID from either the first or final\n" +
"        input document into the new output PDF. Otherwise pdftk creates\n" +
"        a new document ID for the output PDF. When no operation is\n" +
"        given, pdftk always uses the ID from the (single) input PDF.\n" +
"\n" +
"       [drop_xfa]\n" +
"        If your input PDF is a form created using Acrobat 7 or Adobe\n" +
"        Designer, then it probably has XFA data.  Filling such a form\n" +
"        using pdftk yields a PDF with data that fails to display in\n" +
"        Acrobat 7 (and 6?).  The workaround solution is to remove the\n" +
"        form's XFA data, either before you fill the form using pdftk or\n" +
"        at the time you fill the form. Using this option causes pdftk to\n" +
"        omit the XFA data from the output PDF form.\n" +
"\n" +
"        This option is only useful when running pdftk on a single input\n" +
"        PDF.  When assembling a PDF from multiple inputs using pdftk,\n" +
"        any XFA data in the input is automatically omitted.\n" +
"\n" +
"       [drop_xmp]\n" +
"        Many PDFs store document metadata using both an Info dictionary\n" +
"        (old school) and an XMP stream (new school).  Pdftk's\n" +
"        update_info operation can update the Info dictionary, but not\n" +
"        the XMP stream.  The proper remedy for this is to include a\n" +
"        ModDate entry in your updated info with a current date/time-\n" +
"        stamp. The date/timestamp format is: D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSS, e.g.\n" +
"        D:201307241346 -- omitted data after YYYY revert to default val-\n" +
"        ues. This newer ModDate should cue PDF viewers that the Info\n" +
"        metadata is more current than the XMP data.\n" +
"\n" +
"        Alternatively, you might prefer to remove the XMP stream from\n" +
"        the PDF altogether -- that's what this option does.  Note that\n" +
"        objects inside the PDF might have their own, separate XMP meta-\n" +
"        data streams, and that drop_xmp does not remove those.  It only\n" +
"        removes the PDF's document-level XMP stream.\n" +
"\n" +
"       [verbose]\n" +
"        By default, pdftk runs quietly. Append verbose to the end and it\n" +
"        will speak up.\n" +
"\n" +
"       [dont_ask | do_ask]\n" +
"        Depending on the compile-time settings (see ASK_ABOUT_WARNINGS),\n" +
"        pdftk might prompt you for further input when it encounters a\n" +
"        problem, such as a bad password. Override this default behavior\n" +
"        by adding dont_ask (so pdftk won't ask you what to do) or do_ask\n" +
"        (so pdftk will ask you what to do).\n" +
"\n" +
"        When running in dont_ask mode, pdftk will over-write files with\n" +
"        its output without notice.\n" +
